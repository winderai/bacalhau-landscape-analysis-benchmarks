# Single node installation

This set up is straightforward since you only work on a single host.
Proceed by installing each framework and related prerequistes but DO NOT launch any cluster (yet).
Please follow the instructions linked below:

- [Pandas](installation/PANDAS.md)
- [Dask](installation/DASK.md)
- [Postgres](installation/POSTGRE.md)
- [Hadoop](installation/HADOOP.md)
- [Spark](installation/SPARK.md)
- Snowflake ?

At this point we have all frameworks installed.

You're now ready to [run the benchmarks](../benchmark/README.md).
